## Introduction
*"Irasshaimase!"* 
This was a training project early, early on in my coding education. It was a very simple HTML page, not terribly well-built, inspired by the place where I apprenticed as a chef. I'd like to circle back to it and give it a total overhaul, when I'm a bit happier with my developer skills.

**Project Status:** Concluded

### Self-Reflection
- This exercise was before I even touched Bootstrap or a proper framework. I wasn't using snippets at all--every styling was hacked together by hand, like a caveman. I've come a long way.
