## Introduction
This was a training project early, early on in my coding education. Maybe 2 months after I learned what a div is. It was a very simple HTML page, not terribly well-built, inspired by the place where I apprenticed as a chef. I'm preserving this repo to show how far I've come.

**Project Status:** Concluded

### Self-Reflection
- This exercise was before I even touched Bootstrap or a proper framework. I wasn't using snippets at all--every styling was hacked together by hand, like a caveman.
